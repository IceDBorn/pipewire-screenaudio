#### NixOS Flakes

```nix
# flake.nix

{
  inputs.pipewire-screenaudio.url = "github:IceDBorn/pipewire-screenaudio";
  # ...

  outputs = {nixpkgs, pipewire-screenaudio, ...} @ inputs: {
    nixosConfigurations.HOSTNAME = nixpkgs.lib.nixosSystem {
      specialArgs = { inherit inputs; }; # this is the important part
      modules = [
        ./configuration.nix
      ];
    };
  }
}

# configuration.nix

{inputs, pkgs, ...}: {
  environment.systemPackages = with pkgs; [
    (firefox.override { extraNativeMessagingHosts = [ inputs.pipewire-screenaudio.packages.${pkgs.system}.default ]; })
    # ...
  ];
}
```

### Installing from Source

#### Requirements

- gawk
- hexdump
- jq
- pipewire

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IceDBorn/pipewire-screenaudio.git
cd pipewire-screenaudio
bash install.sh
```

## Usage

- Install the [extension](https://addons.mozilla.org/firefox/addon/pipewire-screenaudio)
- Optional: Grant extension with access permissions to all sites
- Join a WebRTC call, click the extension icon, select an audio node and share
- Stream, your transmission should contain both audio and video

## Known Problems

- You can't stream firefox WebRTC calls at all while using `All Desktop Audio`, they are excluded by default

### resistFingerprinting

- privacy.resistFingerprinting (enabled by default in LibreWolf, arkenfox user.js, etc.) breaks the extension. Either disable the preference or add any domains you wish to use Pipewire Screenaudio with to `privacy.resistFingerprinting.exemptedDomains` in `about:config`

### Audio pitching

> Note: The bug is now fixed in the nightly branch of Firefox. This is set to release to the stable branch on December 5th!

- ~~Firefox recently implemented a feature for spawning WebRTC audio nodes, and while it works, it has a lot of pitching and de-sync issues. We created a [bug report](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1844181) on bugzilla and we're hoping for the best!~~

## Planned Features

- Multiple nodes selection
- More customization options (node matching, watcher behavior etc.)
- Chromium support
