Extension to passthrough Pipewire audio to WebRTC Screenshare

Based on [link-app-to-mic](https://github.com/Soundux/rohrkabel/tree/master/examples/link-app-to-mic) and [Screenshare-with-audio-on-Discord-with-Linux](https://github.com/edisionnano/Screenshare-with-audio-on-Discord-with-Linux)

## Installation
### Packages

### Installing from Source
#### Requirements
- gawk
- hexdump
- jq
- pipewire
- psmisc

```bash
git clone https://github.com/IceDBorn/pipewire-screenaudio.git
cd pipewire-screenaudio
bash install.sh
```
## Usage
- Optional: Grant extension with access permissions to all sites
- Join a WebRTC call, click the extension icon, select an audio node and share
- Stream, your transmission should contain both audio and video
 
## Known Problems
- There is no way to change the audio node you're sharing while streaming
- You can't stream firefox WebRTC calls at all while using `All Desktop Audio`, they are excluded by default
### resistFingerprinting
- privacy.resistFingerprinting (enabled by default in LibreWolf, arkenfox user.js, etc.) breaks the extension. Either disable the preference or add any domains you wish to use Pipewire Screenaudio with to `privacy.resistFingerprinting.exemptedDomains` in `about:config`
### Audio pitching
- Firefox recently implemented a feature for spawning WebRTC audio nodes, and while it works, it has a lot of pitching and de-sync issues. We created a [bug report](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1844181) on bugzilla and we're hoping for the best!


## Planned Features
- Multiple nodes selection
- Change audio node while streaming
- More customization options (node matching, watcher behavior etc.)
- Chromium support
